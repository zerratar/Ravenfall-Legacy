# Ravenfall

https://www.ravenfall.stream/

Ravenfall is a Twitch Integrated Idle RPG available for free, the source is openly available with the exception for 3rd party scripts and assets.

If you want to contribute to the project please join our discord community at https://discord.gg/gtfDts7 and give the staff a shout, I'm currently the only developer of this game and it takes a lot of time to bring updates and making sure things run smoothly. So all help is appreciated!

But don't feel like you have to help us out just to be part of the community, we have have tons of users playing this game joined our discord server just to hang out. Why not join in you too?

## What Unity Version?
As of writing, v2023.1.20f1
I try to keep the version up to date with latest releases of Unity to make sure that there are minimal possible issues that may arise with major version updates.
